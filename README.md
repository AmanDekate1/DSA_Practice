# Mastering Data Structurs and algorithms in C/C++

This repository contains notes and practice files from the [Data Structures and Algorithms course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/) by Mr Abdul Bari.
Efforts were made to make the files as readable as possible, by Commenting the code and adding explanations still there is room for improvement.

## Description

The course tackles the most common data structres and algorithms in the [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) 
and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programming languages. Structres include [arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure),
[strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)), [linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), 
[stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), [queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)), 
[binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree), [binary search trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), 
[AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree), [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) and 
[graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)).  Algorithms include those on [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm), 
[hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) and various others, associated with the aforementioned data structures. 
It was underwent in a bid to build upon the knowledge from the previous course, the repository for which can
be found here-

For Practice problems,

# Why C/C++?

I decided to take this course as a head start for the upcoming course on Data Structures in my university. C++ is the programming language we'll use and it's widely known as a great programming language to build a strong foundation.
